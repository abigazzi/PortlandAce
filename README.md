PortlandAce
===========

Portable, low-cost and networked device for assessing cyclists' exposure

This is an application to interface with a Portland ACE device (PORTable, Low-cost And Networked Device for Assessing Cyclists' Exposure). 
The device measures a number of data streams and sends them over Bluetooth to an Android device. 
The application can also interface with the phone's GPS (using Google's MyTracks) and Zephyr's BioHarness and HxM physiology monitors (using Bluetooth). 
It displays and logs data to the phone's storage at 1 Hz.

Note: There is a newer version of this project (including a new app and microcontroller script), living its new life under the SPEC project (Sensing Pollution Exposure by Community).  The new version features a number of improvements and bug fixes, but the new code is not published online at this time.  Info about that project can be found here: http://alexbigazzi.com/Spec/
